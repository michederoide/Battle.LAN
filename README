Battle.LAN is a small game intended to be played between some rounds of casual games on LAN parties.


The game is played as a very easy RPG. You can choose a character with a specific class (e.g. Warrior, Mage, ...)

You can level up, find items to equip and fight with and maybe you are sometimes deluded by your accompanies ;)
